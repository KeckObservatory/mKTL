Glossary
========

This document defines the common nomenclature used within mKTL. Some of the
terms are inherited from KTL; some are inherited from common design patterns
in the broader software world. Where there is a conflict between the two,
we prefer to use the common industry definition rather than traditional use
within WMKO.


External definitions
--------------------

 * **WMKO**:
	     W. M. Keck Observatory, where mKTL was initially established, in
             collaboration with WMKO partner institutions at the University of
             California and California Institute of Technology.

 * **KTL**:
	    Keck Task Library, the predecessor to mKTL at WMKO. KTL is a
            key-value application programming interface (API), written in C,
	    and has been the dominant API for interprocess communication at
	    both WMKO and Lick Observatory since the 1990's.

 * **EPICS**:
	      Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System, another
              key-value API that WMKO adopted for its telescope and
	      adaptive optics control systems. EPICS is one of the interprocess
	      communication APIs for which KTL provides a common abstraction.


mKTL-specific terms
-------------------

 * **mKTL**:
	     Modern Keck Task Library. It's just a name, but it's ours,
             and was the clear choice out of a field of a dozen options
	     that were presented to the future power users of the protocol.

 * **Protocol**:
		Protocol, as used in the above statement, refers to
		a communication protocol, as opposed to an object
		oriented synonym for interface. Borrowing phrasing from
		`Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol>`_,
		a communication protocol defines the rules, syntax,
		semantics, and synchronization of communication between
		two entities.

 * **Daemon**:
		A persistent process responsible for some or all of
		the key-value pairs in a given store. When client
		requests are initiated it is the daemon that will be
		contacted to satisfy the request. This is analagous
		to a KTL dispatcher or an EPICS IOC.

 * **Store**:
	      A store is an aggregation of individual key-value pairs.
              Within a given deployment of mKTL the store will have a
	      unique name. This is analagous to a KTL service, or an
	      EPICS database, and is effectively an associative array,
	      or a Python dictionary. "Database" is another term used
	      in similar contexts, but that term is more commonly used
	      in reference to a relational database. mKTL treats the
	      store name as case-insensitive, any actual usage will
	      render it as all lower-case.

 * **Key**:
	    A unique name within a store, identifying a single key-value
            pair. This is analagous to a KTL keyword, or an EPICS channel.
	    mKTL treats the key as case-insensitive, any actual usage will
	    render it as all upper-case.

 * **Value**:
              The other half of the key-value pair. Like a KTL keyword,
              a mKTL value can be one of many native types (integer,
	      floating point, string, etc.), and includes the possibility
	      of compound values, similar to KTL arrays.

 * **Item**:
	     The combination of the key/value pair. This term is borrowed
             from Python's dictionary, where it has a similar meaning. In
	     the context of mKTL, the Store class in the reference Python
	     module will return Item instances when referenced by the key.

 * **Get**:
	    Retrieve a value corresponding to an individual key in a store.
            A typical client can issue a blocking or a non-blocking
	    (synchronous or asynchronous) operation. This is analagous to
	    a KTL read or an EPICS get.

 * **Set**:
	    Establish a new value for an individual key in a store. A typical
            client can request a blocking or a non-blocking (synchronous or
	    asynchronous) operation. This is analagous to a KTL modify or an
	    EPICS put.

 * **Publish**:
		Broadcast a new value for an individual key in a store.
                The store name combined with the key makes up the bulk of
		the topic, which in turn has specific meaning in a typical
		`publish-subscribe design pattern <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern>`_.

 * **Subscribe**:
		  Request the receipt of any/all published broadcasts of an
                  individual key in a store. This is analagous to a KTL monitor
		  or EPICS monitor request.

 * **Callback**:
		 A method to be called whenever a published broadcast arrives
                 for an individual key in a store.

 * **Register**:
		 The act of associating a callback with a specific key in a
                 store. The callback will now be invoked whenever the value
		 of that key changes. "Connect" is another term used in
		 similar contexts, but that term is more commonly used with
		 network sockets.
