usage: mk [-h] [-s STORE] [--serial] [--no-wait] [--formatted] [--unformatted]
          [-u UNITS]
          {get,set,watch,describe,discover,list} [requests ...]

This is the mKTL command line interface. The real work is done in the
mktl Python library; this executable parses command-line flags, invokes
mktl routines to handle any/all requests, and otherwise waits until all
requests are complete. Note that the default is to execute all requests
in parallel.

positional arguments:
  {get,set,watch,describe,discover,list}
                        Request type
  requests              Whitespace-separated sequence of requests. For a get,
                        watch, or describe request, this is a sequence of
                        keys; for a set request, this is a sequence of
                        key=value statements; for a list request this is a
                        sequence of stores; for a discover request this is a
                        sequence of broker addresses.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s, --store STORE     Name of an mKTL store to prefix to all subsequent
                        keys.
  --serial              Process all requests serially. The default is to
                        process requests in parallel.
  --no-wait             Do not wait until all set requests are complete before
                        exiting. The default is to wait. --no-wait is not
                        compatible with --serial.
  --formatted           Show the formatted value for get requests, and
                        interpret the provided value as formatted for set
                        requests. This is the default behavior.
  --unformatted         Show the unformatted value for get requests, and
                        interpret the provided value as unformatted for set
                        requests. The default is to use the formatted value.
  -u, --units UNITS     Use the requested units for getting or setting tem
                        values. Note that this option is applied to all
                        requests, and is not practical when interacting with
                        multiple items.

Example usage:

    mk get rosebud.model rosebud.length
    mk get -s rosebud model length height color
    mk set rosebud.speed=50
    mk set -s rosebud speed=50 passengers=2 --no-wait
    mk watch rosebud.model rosebud.length
    mk watch -s rosebud model length height color
    mk list -s rosebud
    mk list rosebud redflyer
