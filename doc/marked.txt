usage: marked [-h] [-m MODULE] [-s SUBCLASS] [-c CONFIGURATION] [-a APPCONFIG]
              store alias

This is a generic mKTL daemon. The real work is done in the subclass of
mktl.Daemon (if any); this executable parses command-line flags, invokes
a mktl.Daemon instance to handle any/all requests, and otherwise waits
until the program is terminated.

The store name and configuration alias must be specified in order for
this daemon to function correctly; all other arguments are optional.

positional arguments:
  store                 Name of this mKTL store.
  alias                 Unique alias for the mKTL configuration associated
                        with this specific daemon; this is an arbitrary
                        string, and must be unique for this daemon within this
                        store.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -m, --module MODULE   Module to import which contains the mktl.Daemon
                        subclass to invoke.
  -s, --subclass SUBCLASS
                        Specific mktl.Daemon subclass to invoke; this is the
                        bare class name (Daemon), not a fully qualified class
                        name (mktl.Daemon).
  -c, --configuration CONFIGURATION
                        File containing daemon-specific mKTL configuration of
                        items; if specified, the contents of this file will
                        supplant any cached daemon-specific configuration for
                        this store+alias.
  -a, --appconfig APPCONFIG
                        Custom configuration file location, not used directly
                        by mKTL, but made available to the mktl.Daemon
                        subclass. How this directive is used is entirely up to
                        the application-specific subclass code.

For example, to run marked for the store 'rosebud', using the existing
on-disk configuration identified as 'innocence', first using the default
caching implementation, and then with a custom Kane.Sled subclass of
mktl.Daemon, one might invoke:

    marked rosebud innocence
    marked rosebud innocence --module Kane --subclass Sled
