usage: mark [-h] [-s STORE] [--serial] [--no-wait]
            {get,set,watch,list} [requests ...]

This is the mKTL command line interface. The real work is done in the
mktl Python library; this executable parses command-line flags, invokes
mktl routines to handle any/all requests, and otherwise waits until all
requests are complete. Note that the default is to execute all requests
in parallel.

positional arguments:
  {get,set,watch,list}  Request type
  requests              Whitespace-separated sequence of requests. For a get
                        or a watch request, this is a sequence of keys; for a
                        set request, this is a sequence of key=value
                        statements. For a list request this is a sequence of
                        stores.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s, --store STORE     Name of an mKTL store to prefix to all subsequent
                        keys.
  --serial              Process all requests serially. The default is to
                        process requests in parallel.
  --no-wait             Do not wait until all set requests are complete before
                        exiting. The default is to wait. --no-wait is not
                        compatible with --serial.

Example usage:

    mark get rosebud.model rosebud.length
    mark get -s rosebud model length height color
    mark set rosebud.speed=50
    mark set -s rosebud speed=50 passengers=2 --no-wait
    mark watch rosebud.model rosebud.length
    mark watch -s rosebud model length height color
    mark list -s rosebud
    mark list rosebud redflyer
