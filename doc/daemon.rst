Daemon interface
================

A daemon is the source of authority for one or more mKTL items; when a client
gets or sets an item value, that request is handled by the daemon. Exactly
how that request gets handled is entirely up to the daemon code; there are no
restrictions imposed by the mKTL protocol itself, it is up to the daemon to
resolve any consistency issues or conflicting requests.

The default behavior of the :class:`mktl.Store` is to act as a caching
key/value store: values come in, values go out, they may or may not persist
across restarts depending on the configuration. This behavior is rarely
sufficient for an application; a typical daemon will implement custom code
behind the getting and setting of individual items. The Python interface
described here expects the user to create custom subclasses of
:class:`mktl.Daemon`, which in turn may instantiate custom subclasses of
:class:`mktl.Item`. Background threads are used widely, polling and callbacks
in particular are two areas where dedicated per-item background threads will
invoke any/all registered methods; the author of any custom code should not
assume that calls arriving via these mechanisms will be serialized or
thread-safe to any meaningful degree.


The Daemon class
----------------

The :class:`mktl.Daemon` class is the entry point and overall organization
for the daemon; while it provides a common storage location for daemon-wide
functions, such as handling requests and publishing broadcasts, from the
perspective of the developer the :class:`mktl.Store` is a container for
the :class:`mktl.Item` instances that define the actual behavior of the
system. An incoming set request, for example, is not handled by the
any higher level construct, it is passed to the appropriate :class:`mktl.Item`
instance for proper handling.

The :class:`mktl.Daemon` also defines the initialization sequence, if any,
for the daemon: which steps to take upon startup, which
:class:`mktl.Item` subclasses to invoke for specific items, whether other
initialization steps must occur such as defining a common communication point
to access a hardware controller, or whether the initial state of a set of
items needs to be manipulated before proceeding with routine operations.

In most cases the developer will need to create a custom :class:`mktl.Daemon`
subclass to satisfy the operational goals of an application. Likewise, in most
cases the developer will need to create custom :class:`mktl.Item` subclasses
to implement application-specific behavior, with special attention paid to the
:ref:`specific methods to override <item_subclassing>`, and
:ref:`additional methods useful in a daemon context <item_daemon_methods>`.

Configuration management
------------------------

Largely for internal use, there are some aspects of the
:class:`mktl.config.Configuration` class that are directly relevant for use
within a daemon. A reference to the appropriate Configuration instance can
be accesssed as an attribute of the :class:`mktl.Store`, or via the
:func:`mktl.config.get` method; :class:`mktl.config.Configuration` instances
are singletons.

.. autoclass:: mktl.config.Configuration
   :members: convert_units, from_format, from_quantity, keys, to_format, to_quantity, update, uuids

In addition to the class itself there are an assortment of helper methods,
two of which are potentially relevant in a daemon context:

.. autofunction:: mktl.config.authoritative

.. autofunction:: mktl.config.get


mkd executable
--------------

The `mkd` executable provides a command-line interface to invoke a
persistent daemon executing a :class:`mktl.Daemon` subclass as described above.
It is the natural starting point for any persistent daemon implementing
the scheme described in this document, since that is the precise purpose
it is written for.

Refer to the section covering :ref:`mkd` in the :ref:`executables`
documentation for additional details.
