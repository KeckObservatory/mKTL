Daemon interface
================

.. py:module:: mKTL.Daemon

A daemon is the source of authority for one or more mKTL items; when a client
gets or sets an item value, that request is handled by the daemon. Exactly
how that request gets handled is entirely up to the daemon code; there are no
restrictions imposed by the mKTL protocol itself, it is up to the daemon to
resolve any consistency issues or conflicting requests.

The default behavior of the :class:`Store` is to act as a caching
key/value store: values come in, values go out, they may or may not persist
across restarts depending on the configuration. This behavior is rarely
sufficient for an application; a typical daemon will implement custom code
behind the getting and setting of individual items. The reference implementation
in Python expects the user to create custom subclasses of
:class:`Store`, which in turn may instantiate custom subclasses of
:class:`Item`.


Daemon.Store class
------------------

The :class:`Store` class is the entry point and overall organization
for the daemon; while it provides a common storage location for daemon-wide
functions, such as handling requests and publishing broadcasts, from the
perspective of the developer the :class:`Store` is a container for
the :class:`Item` instances that define the actual behavior of the
system. A request, for example, is not handled by the
:class:`Store`, it is passed to the appropriate
:class:`Item` instance for proper handling.

The :class:`Store` also defines the initialization sequence, if any,
for the daemon: which steps to take upon startup, which
:class:`Item` subclasses to invoke for specific items, whether other
initialization steps must occur such as defining a common communication point
to access a hardware controller, or whether the initial state of a set of items
needs to be manipulated before proceeding with routine operations.

In nearly all cases the developer will need to create a custom
:class:`Store` subclass to satisfy the operational goals of an
individual daemon.

.. autoclass:: Store
   :members:


Daemon.Item class
------------------

The bulk of any daemon-specific logic will occur in :class:`Item` subclasses.
This is where requests get handled, where data gets interpreted, where logic
is defined that could span items within and without the boundaries of the
containing :class:`Store` instance.

Subclass definitions of the :func:`Item.req_refresh`, :func:`Item.req_set`, and
:func:`Item.validate` methods are especially important for defining any custom
behavior. Any method with a `req_` prefix is part of the handling chain
for an inbound request, though of the ones defined here ony :func`Item.req_get`
and :func:`Item.req_set` are called directly, though if necessary
:func:`Item.req_get` calls :func:`Item.req_refresh` in order to acquire the
most recent value.
